# Searching Etsy

An all client-side and dependency-free app that searches Etsy for you. It is written completely in ES6 and transpiled with babel.

##Compatibility
This site was tested on Chrome 50. Any other modern browser should work, except IE. 

## Deploy
```
npm install
```

Then just serve up the root directory using your favorite webserver. I used python SimpleHTTPServer. 

## Features
In addition to typing in the input box and searching Etsy, this app as a few other features.

### Bookmarkable Search
You can navigate to the root page with the `?q=[search term]` query parameter and the page will automatically search on that term.

### Forward and Back
Every search utilizes HTML5 `pushState()` api, essentially going to a different url. This allows for the user to go back and forth between searches by going forward or back in the browser.

### Infinite Scroll
As the user scrolls, automatically fetch more results.

### Responsive
The the site is fairly responsive thanks to Twitter Bootstrap.
